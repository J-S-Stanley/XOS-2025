Note on duplicate samples in "Raw MiSeq output files" folder:

During library preparation, some samples were inadvertently processed twice due to uncertainty about whether DNA had been added to specific wells. To prevent potential omission of these samples from the analysis — had DNA been added twice to a single well — the decision was made to create an additional well for the affected samples.

Following sequencing, samples with duplicate entries (e.g. 16C) were curated as follows: if the original well contained sufficient sequencing reads, the duplicate was removed; conversely, if the original well yielded low or no reads, the duplicate sample was retained while the original was excluded from all analyses. This approach ensured that all valid samples were included while avoiding errors stemming from undetected DNA omission or duplication.
